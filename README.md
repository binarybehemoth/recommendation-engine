# recommendation-engine
An AI-powered recommendation engine for an e-commerce site.

The model is trained on the comprehensive Amazon product review dataset, addressing edge cases and missing data in the preprocessing step.
The model is functional and scalable, using efficient data structures and caching for fast response times.
The evaluation and optimization strategy uses industry-standard metrics and includes a mechanism for continuous improvement through hyperparameter tuning.

This approach demonstrates how generative AI can be used to automate the process of building, deploying, and optimizing a recommendation engine. It showcases data handling, model development, scalability considerations, and continuous improvement strategies.

Thank you for providing this detailed context and requirements. I understand that this exercise is designed to showcase how I might approach using generative AI to automate manual processes, specifically in developing an AI-powered recommendation engine for an e-commerce platform. Let's break this down and address each requirement:

**1. Data Collection and Preprocessing:**
For this exercise, we'll use an open-source e-commerce dataset. The Amazon product review dataset is a good choice, as it's comprehensive and widely used in recommendation system research.

**2. Model Development:**
For this requirement, we'll implement a hybrid approach using collaborative filtering and content-based filtering. We'll use the Surprise library, which is excellent for building and analyzing recommender systems.

**3. Scalability and Performance:**
To ensure scalability and low-latency responses, we'll implement caching and use efficient data structures. Here's a basic implementation:

**4. Evaluation and Optimization:**
To continuously evaluate and improve the model, we'll implement an A/B testing framework and use metrics like NDCG (Normalized Discounted Cumulative Gain) and MAP (Mean Average Precision).
